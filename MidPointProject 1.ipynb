    "Project Description: Website Sign-Up\n",
    "In this project, you will write a program that prompts a user to sign up for a website. The user must come up with a username and password, then log in using the username and password.\n",
    "There are requirements for both the username and password. If either one doesn't meet the requirements, print an appropriate error message and ask the username for a new username and password.\n",
    "If they are both valid, store them as variables. Then ask the user to log in using the username and password they chose.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem: How should I start? \n",
    "# Solution: Your program should start with a string in the input functions that clearly explains to the user both the username and password requirements. \n",
    "username = input(\"Enter a valid username (starts with lowercase letter, only letters, numbers, and underscores): \")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem: The user must be continuously prompted for input.\n",
    "# Solution(s): What tools do we have in place to facilitate this? If-then-else statements in conjunction with a while loop. \n",

    "# Problem: How are we managing error messages?\n",
    "# Solution(s): We can serve error messages from strings in variables. We can serve error messages from a collection instrument such as a list. Bad practice would be hardcoding error messages in our code. Though it works, it would be come difficult to handle and manage should a program be scaled up in the future or new error messages are added in the future with features. Handle this before you begin your while loop\n",

Ternary operators are off the table as they cannot be used in a conditional expression."
